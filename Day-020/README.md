## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 020** was to:

- Revise all previously learned core concepts
- Improve logical thinking through practice
- Identify weak areas
- Increase coding speed and confidence

This day focused on **retention + implementation**, not learning new topics.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Revised

### Core Java Fundamentals

- Methods
- Method Overloading
- Recursion basics
- Strings
- StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

### DSA Foundations

- Arrays (1D & 2D)
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Time & Space Complexity

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

I solved mixed problems from different topics:

- Array traversal & manipulation
- Searching elements efficiently
- Implementing sorting algorithms
- String-based logic building
- Dry run of time complexity

The main focus was:

✔ Writing clean code  
✔ Reducing mistakes  
✔ Improving logic clarity

## 🔄 Revision Strategy

Effective revision includes:

1. Rewriting important programs without seeing old code
2. Doing dry runs for better understanding
3. Comparing optimized vs brute-force approaches
4. Focusing on weak areas

Revision turns **basic understanding → strong retention**.

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### ✔ Practice Programs

The implementation includes:

- Array operations
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting techniques
- String manipulation problems

📄 **Java Source Files:**  
👉 ArrayRevision.java  
👉 SearchingRevision.java  
👉 SortingRevision.java  
👉 StringRevision.java

---

## 📝 Notes & Observations

- Revision exposes small mistakes in logic
- Binary Search requires careful boundary handling
- Bubble Sort is easy but inefficient for large data
- Writing code without reference improves confidence
- Dry run helps in interviews

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Revision is as important as learning new concepts
- Strong fundamentals make DSA easier
- Clean code improves readability
- Practice increases speed and accuracy
- Consistency is the real progress

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 20 Level)

**Q1. Why is revision important in programming?**  
Revision strengthens memory, improves speed, and helps in identifying weak areas.

**Q2. Which searching algorithm is faster and why?**  
Binary Search, because it works in **O(log n)** time by dividing the search space.

**Q3. Why is Bubble Sort inefficient for large datasets?**  
Because its time complexity is **O(n²)**.

**Q4. What improves problem-solving ability the most?**  
Consistent practice and dry running the code.
