# 🧠 Day 020 – Revision + Practice Notes

## 🔁 Why Revision is Important

Revision helps to:

- Convert short-term memory → long-term memory
- Improve coding speed
- Reduce logical mistakes
- Build confidence for interviews

Without revision, concepts fade quickly.

## 🧩 Topics Revised

### 1️⃣ Arrays

- Traversal
- Sum & average
- Maximum & minimum element
- Reverse array

Time Complexity:

- Traversal → O(n)

---

### 2️⃣ Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search

- Works on unsorted arrays
- Checks element one by one

Time Complexity:

- Best Case → O(1)
- Worst Case → O(n)

---

### Binary Search

- Works only on sorted arrays
- Divides search space into half

Time Complexity:

- O(log n)

---

## 3️⃣ Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements
- Largest element moves to the end

Time Complexity:

- Worst Case → O(n²)

---

### Selection Sort

- Finds minimum element and places at correct position

Time Complexity:

- O(n²)

---

## 4️⃣ Strings Revision

Important operations:

- Reverse a string
- Count vowels
- Palindrome check
- Character frequency

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting array bounds  
❌ Wrong loop conditions in Binary Search  
❌ Not resetting variables  
❌ Confusing `i` and `j` in nested loops

---

## 💡 Interview Tips

✔ Always start with brute-force approach  
✔ Then move to optimized solution  
✔ Explain time complexity  
✔ Dry run with example

---

## 🚀 Confidence Boost After Revision

Before Revision:

- Knew concepts but slow in coding

After Revision:

- Faster implementation
- Better logic clarity
- Fewer syntax errors
