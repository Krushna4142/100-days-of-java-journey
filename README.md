# 🚀 100 Days of Java – A Daily Learning Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Java Journey**, where I consistently learn, code and document Java fundamentals one day at a time.

This repo is part of a **commitment to disciplined learning, real understanding, and practical skills**, not just random code dumps.

---

## 🧠 What This Challenge Is About

This challenge is inspired by the global **100 Days of Code movement** where developers commit to coding daily and sharing progress publicly.  
My goal is to:

✔ Build strong Core Java fundamentals  
✔ Practice daily real programs  
✔ Document learning clearly  
✔ Build recruiter-friendly code + explanations  
✔ Bridge gap between theory and practice  

---

## 📜 Rules I Follow

1. Write Java code **every single day**  
2. Create a dedicated folder for each day  
3. Include:
   - Java source code
   - Clear explanation in `README.md`
4. Use meaningful commit messages  
5. Never skip documentation  
6. Present progress publicly on GitHub

## 📅 Daily Progress Tracker

- 🔹 [Day 001 – Java Introduction & Hello World](./Day-001)
- 🔹 [Day 002 – Variables & Data Types](./Day-002)
- 🔹 [Day 003 – Input using Scanner](./Day-003)
- 🔹 [Day 004 – Operators in Java](./Day-004)
- 🔹 [Day 005 – If-Else Decision Making](./Day-005)
- 🔹 [Day 006 – Else-If Ladder & Switch Statement](./Day-006)

> *More days will be added here with link to their folders as this journey continues.*

## 📁 Organized Folder Structure

Each day has a directory that contains:
- A Java program focused on that day’s topic  
- A `README.md` explaining the concept and output

100-days-of-java/
│
├── Day-001/
│ ├── HelloWorld.java
│ └── README.md
│
├── Day-002/
│ ├── VariablesDemo.java
│ └── README.md
│
├── Day-005/
│ ├── IfElseProgram.java
│ └── README.md
│
└── README.md

## 📌 Why This Approach Works

Most 100-day challenge repos either just dump code or lack explanations.  
This repo stands out because it has:

✔ Daily explanations that are easy to understand  
✔ Recruiter-friendly structure  
✔ A story that *shows progress*  
✔ Practical, readable code  
✔ Documented learning for each day  
✔ Consistent commit messages

This mirrors the structure and clarity seen in high-quality challenge repos — but tailored to focus on **Java fundamentals with explanations at every step**

---

## ✨ How to Use This Repo

If you’re just starting Java or you want to follow along:

1. Begin with `Day-001/README.md`  
2. Read the explanation  
3. Open the Java code and run it locally  
4. Understand outputs and edge cases  
5. Try variations of the code

---

## 📦 How to Run the Programs

Each program can be compiled and run using:

```bash
javac MyFileName.java
java MyFileName
Replace MyFileName with the Java file in each Day folder.

📌 Final Note
This repository is more than just code — it’s a daily commitment to improving as a developer.
I believe learning with discipline and documenting clearly is the key to mastery.

💪 Let’s keep learning and building — one day at a time!
