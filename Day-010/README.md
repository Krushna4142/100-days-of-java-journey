## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 010** is to move from **static arrays** to **dynamic arrays** by:

- Taking array size from the user
- Accepting array elements using `Scanner`
- Processing real user data
- Performing basic operations on user-input arrays

📌 This is where Java starts to feel **real-world**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Arrays + Scanner

- Dynamic array creation
- Taking input using loops
- Accessing user-provided data

### 🔹 Array Operations

- Printing elements
- Calculating sum
- Finding average
- Finding maximum element

---

## 🛠️ What I Built

A **clean Java program** that:

- Asks the user for array size
- Takes array elements as input
- Displays elements
- Calculates:
  - Sum
  - Average
  - Maximum value

✔ Beginner-friendly  
✔ Interview-oriented  
✔ No unnecessary complexity

## 🧩 Program Flow

1. Take array size from user
2. Create array dynamically
3. Take elements using loop
4. Perform calculations
5. Display results clearly

---

## 📝 Notes

- User input makes programs dynamic
- Arrays + loops are core DSA tools
- This pattern repeats in almost every real project

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Arrays can be created using user input
- `Scanner` + loops are essential
- Avoid hardcoded values
- Always validate logic with sample inputs

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 10 Level)

**Q1. How do you take array input in Java?**  
Using `Scanner` and a loop.

**Q2. Can array size be dynamic in Java?**  
Size is fixed after creation, but it can be decided at runtime.

**Q3. Why use loops for array input?**  
Because array elements are accessed using index.

**Q4. What happens if index exceeds array length?**  
`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
