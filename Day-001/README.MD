# Day 001 – Java Introduction & First Program

## 📌 What I Did Today
- Installed and configured Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Understood the basic structure of a Java program
- Learned how Java code is executed
- Wrote my first Java program

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- Java is a **platform-independent** programming language
- A Java program starts execution from the `main()` method
- Source code is compiled into bytecode and executed by the JVM

---

## ⚙️ Java Execution Flow
.java → compiler → .class → JVM → Output


- **JDK**: Used to develop Java programs
- **JRE**: Provides runtime environment
- **JVM**: Executes bytecode

---

## 💻 Code Explanation
- Created a simple Java class
- Used `System.out.println()` to print output
- Understood class and method syntax

---

## ❓ Interview Insight
**Q:** Why is Java platform independent?  
**A:** Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM.
Since JVM is available for different operating systems, Java programs
can run anywhere without modification.

## ✅ Outcome of the Day
- Java environment successfully set up
- First Java program executed
- Foundation for upcoming days established
