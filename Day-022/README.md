## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 022** was to deeply understand how **classes act as blueprints** and how **objects are created and used in memory**.

This day focused on:

- Creating custom classes
- Defining attributes and methods
- Instantiating multiple objects
- Accessing object data using reference variables

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Class Related

- Class declaration
- Instance variables
- Methods inside a class

### Object Related

- Object creation using `new` keyword
- Reference variables
- Accessing data using dot (`.`) operator
- Multiple objects of the same class

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

- Created a custom class to model a real-world entity
- Defined properties and behaviors inside the class
- Created multiple objects with different data
- Called methods using object references

This helped in understanding how **each object has its own separate state in memory**.

## 🧩 Understanding Class & Object

### 🔹 Class

A class is a **user-defined data type** that acts as a blueprint.

It defines:

- What an object **has** → variables
- What an object **does** → methods

### 🔹 Object

An object is:

- A real instance of a class
- Created using the `new` keyword
- Stored in heap memory
- Accessed using a reference variable

Each object:

- Has its own copy of instance variables
- Can call the same methods

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### ✔ Class & Object Demo Program

The program demonstrates:

- Creating a class
- Defining attributes and methods
- Creating multiple objects
- Accessing data using object references

📄 **Java Source File:**  
👉 [ClassObjectDemo.java](./ClassObjectDemo.java)

---

## 📝 Notes & Observations

- Class is a logical structure → object is a physical reality
- Objects are stored in heap memory
- Reference variable stores the address of the object
- Multiple objects can share the same method definitions
- This is the foundation for all OOP features

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Class = blueprint, Object = real entity
- Objects allow real-world modeling in programs
- Each object maintains its own data
- Methods define common behavior for all objects
- Understanding this is essential before moving to inheritance and polymorphism

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 22 Level)

**Q1. What is a class?**  
A class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

**Q2. What is an object?**  
An object is an instance of a class that contains actual values and can access class methods.

**Q3. Where are objects stored in memory?**  
Objects are stored in heap memory.

**Q4. What does a reference variable store?**  
It stores the address of the object.

**Q5. Can we create multiple objects from one class?**  
Yes, and each object will have its own separate data.

### 👉 **Day 023 – Inheritance**

Next, I will:

- Create parent and child classes
- Understand code reusability
- Learn `extends` keyword
- Explore real-world hierarchy
