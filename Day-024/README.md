# Day 024 – Polymorphism

## 📌 Objective

Understand and implement Polymorphism in Java using method overloading and method overriding to achieve runtime and compile-time flexibility.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- What is Polymorphism?
- Types of Polymorphism
  - Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
  - Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
- Dynamic Method Dispatch
- Upcasting
- `super` keyword in overriding
- Covariant return type

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
- JDK 8+

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Compile the file  
   `javac FileName.java`
4. Run the program  
   `java FileName`

---

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes

- Achieved compile-time polymorphism using multiple methods with same name but different parameters.
- Implemented runtime polymorphism using inheritance and method overriding.
- Learned how parent reference can hold child object.
- Understood dynamic method dispatch mechanism.

---

## 🔍 Real-World Use Cases

- Method overloading → Same operation with different inputs (e.g., payment methods)
- Method overriding → Different behavior of same method (e.g., vehicle movement)
- Runtime polymorphism → Achieving flexibility and extensibility in frameworks
