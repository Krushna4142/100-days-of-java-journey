## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 021** was to understand the **fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and why it is used in real-world software development.

This day focused on:

- Transitioning from procedural thinking → object-oriented thinking
- Understanding the four pillars of OOP
- Learning how OOP improves scalability and maintainability

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core OOP Principles

- Class & Object
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

### Supporting Concepts

- Attributes (variables)
- Behaviors (methods)
- Real-world entity modeling
- Code reusability

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

- Learned the difference between **procedural programming and OOP**
- Understood how real-world entities are represented using **classes and objects**
- Explored the **four pillars of OOP** with simple examples
- Observed how OOP helps in writing **modular and reusable code**

This day was focused on **concept clarity**, not complex implementation.

## 🧩 Why OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming helps in:

- Organizing code into logical structures
- Improving code reusability
- Making applications scalable
- Enhancing security using encapsulation
- Reducing duplication

Instead of writing everything inside `main()`,  
we divide the program into **objects that interact with each other**.

This is how real-world applications are built.

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### ✔ OOP Overview Program

The program demonstrates:

- A simple class creation
- Object creation
- Accessing attributes and methods

📄 **Java Source File:**  
👉 [OOPOverview.java](./OOPOverview.java)

---

## 📝 Notes & Observations

- OOP is a **design approach**, not just a syntax change
- Everything in real applications revolves around objects
- Proper planning of classes makes code clean and scalable
- This is the turning point from beginner → developer mindset

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- OOP models real-world entities into code
- It makes large programs manageable
- Code becomes reusable and modular
- Understanding OOP is essential for backend development and interviews

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 21 Level)

**Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?**  
OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects that contain data and methods.

**Q2. What are the four pillars of OOP?**  
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

**Q3. Why is OOP important?**  
It provides modularity, reusability, scalability, and better code organization.

**Q4. What is the difference between class and object?**  
A class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance of that class.
