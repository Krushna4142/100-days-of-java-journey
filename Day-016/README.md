## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 016** was to understand how data can be stored and processed in a **tabular format using 2D arrays**.

This day focused on:

- Learning matrix representation in Java
- Traversing 2D arrays using nested loops
- Performing row-wise and column-wise operations

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### 2D Array Fundamentals

- Declaration of 2D arrays
- Memory representation
- Initialization using values
- Taking input using loops

### Traversal Techniques

- Row-wise traversal
- Column-wise traversal
- Printing matrix in proper format

### Problem-Solving Skills

- Row sum
- Column sum
- Matrix addition (basic)

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

I implemented programs for:

- Creating and printing a matrix
- Taking matrix input from user
- Finding row-wise sum
- Finding column-wise sum
- Adding two matrices

The focus was on **nested loop mastery and index control**.

## 🧩 Understanding 2D Array Logic

A 2D array works in **rows and columns**.

Each element is accessed using:

arr[row][column]

yaml
Copy code

### Core Logic:

1. Outer loop → controls rows
2. Inner loop → controls columns
3. Print elements in structured format

This same logic will be used in:

- Matrix problems
- Grid-based problems
- Game development logic
- Advanced DSA

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### ✔ 2D Array Practice Programs

The implementation includes:

- Matrix creation
- Matrix traversal
- Row & column operations
- Matrix addition

📄 **Java Source Files:**

👉 [TwoDArrayBasics.java](./TwoDArrayBasics.java)  
👉 [MatrixInput.java](./MatrixInput.java)  
👉 [MatrixTraversal.java](./MatrixTraversal.java)  
👉 [RowColumnSum.java](./RowColumnSum.java)  
👉 [MatrixAddition.java](./MatrixAddition.java)

## 📝 Notes & Observations

- 2D arrays always require nested loops
- Row index remains fixed while traversing columns
- Proper formatting improves output readability
- Visualizing matrix helps avoid logical errors

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 2D arrays are the foundation of matrix-based DSA
- Nested loops are essential for traversal
- Index handling is the most important skill
- Matrix problems are easier when visualized

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 016 Level)

**Q1. What is a 2D array?**  
A 2D array is an array of arrays used to store data in rows and columns.

**Q2. How do you traverse a 2D array?**  
Using nested loops where the outer loop controls rows and the inner loop controls columns.

**Q3. Where are 2D arrays used in real life?**  
In matrices, games, image processing, and table-based data.

**Q4. Difference between 1D and 2D array?**  
1D array stores data linearly, while 2D array stores data in tabular form.

**Q5. What is the time complexity to traverse a matrix?**  
O(n × m)
