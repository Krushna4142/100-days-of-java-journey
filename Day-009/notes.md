# 📘 Day 009 – Arrays (Basics)

## 🔹 Why Arrays Are Important

Arrays allow storing multiple values using a single variable name.
They make programs cleaner, faster, and scalable.

---

## 🔹 Array Syntax

Declaration:
int[] arr;

Initialization:
arr = new int[5];

Declaration + Initialization:
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};

---

## 🔹 Key Properties

- Fixed size
- Same data type
- Index-based access
- Stored in contiguous memory

---

## 🔹 Traversing an Array

Use loop from 0 to length-1

Never hardcode size. Always use:
arr.length

---

## 🔹 Common Mistakes

- Accessing index out of bounds
- Forgetting index starts at 0
- Using wrong loop condition

---

## 🔹 Interview Focus

- Array definition
- Index concept
- Difference between array & variables
- Time complexity of traversal → O(n)

---

## ✅ Summary

Arrays are the backbone of DSA.
Strong array basics make learning:

- Sorting
- Searching
- Matrices
  much easier.
