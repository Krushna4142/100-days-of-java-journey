## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 009** was to understand the **fundamentals of arrays in Java** and learn how to:

- Store multiple values using a single variable
- Access elements using index
- Traverse arrays using loops
- Perform basic operations like sum and max

Arrays are the **foundation of Data Structures**, making this a crucial learning day.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Array Basics

- Definition of an array
- Fixed size nature
- Same data type elements
- Index-based access (0-based)

### 🔹 Arrays + Loops

- Traversing arrays using `for` loop
- Using `length` property
- Performing calculations on array elements

---

## 🛠️ What I Built

I implemented a **Java program** that demonstrates:

- Array declaration & initialization
- Printing all array elements
- Calculating sum of elements
- Finding maximum element

📌 Beginner-friendly  
📌 No collections  
📌 No advanced Java concepts

## 🧩 How Arrays Work in Java

- Arrays store multiple values of the **same data type**
- Memory is allocated **contiguously**
- Each element is accessed using an index
- Index starts from **0**

Example:

int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};

Index → 0 1 2
Value → 10 20 30

---

## 📝 Notes

- Arrays reduce code duplication
- They improve readability and performance
- Array traversal is one of the most common interview patterns
- Almost every DSA problem starts with arrays

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Arrays store multiple values efficiently
- Index starts from 0
- `array.length` gives total number of elements
- Loops and arrays are used together frequently

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 09 Level)

**Q1. What is an array in Java?**  
An array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

**Q2. What is the index of the first element in an array?**  
0

**Q3. Can array size be changed after creation?**  
No, array size is fixed in Java.

**Q4. How do you find the length of an array?**  
Using the `length` property.
