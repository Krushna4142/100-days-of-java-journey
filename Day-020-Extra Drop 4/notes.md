# 🧠 Design Notes — Student Management System

## Why This Project Matters

This is my first program where multiple Java concepts work together
to form a complete system instead of isolated examples.

It represents the transition from:

Java syntax → Java application development

---

## 🏗 Design Decisions

### 1. Why Array?

To implement a database-like structure using only core fundamentals.

This keeps the focus on:

- Logic building
- Memory handling
- Index management

---

### 2. Why Separate Student Class?

To achieve:

- Data abstraction
- Clean code structure
- Real-world modeling

This follows basic OOP design thinking.

---

### 3. Why Menu-Driven Approach?

Menu-driven programs:

- Simulate real CLI tools
- Improve user interaction
- Make programs scalable

---

## ⚠ Challenges Faced

- Managing array shifting during deletion
- Handling Scanner input buffer
- Structuring methods cleanly

---

## 🧩 What I Would Improve Next

- Use ArrayList instead of array
- Add file handling for persistence
- Add validation layer
- Convert to full OOP architecture

---
