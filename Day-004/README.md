# Day 04 – Operators & Expressions in Java ⚙️

Welcome to **Day 04** of my **100 Days of Java Journey** 🚀  
Today I learned how Java performs calculations, comparisons, and logical decisions using **operators**.

---

## 📌 What are Operators?

Operators are **special symbols** used to perform operations on variables and values.

Example:

```java
int sum = a + b;
Here, + is an operator.

🔢 Types of Operators in Java
1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations.

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulus (remainder)
Example:

int result = 10 % 3; // Output: 1
2️⃣ Relational (Comparison) Operators
Used to compare two values.

Operator	Meaning
==	Equal to
!=	Not equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
Example:

System.out.println(a > b);
3️⃣ Logical Operators
Used with boolean values.

Operator	Meaning
&&	Logical AND
`
!	Logical NOT
Example:

if (age >= 18 && hasVoterId) {
    System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
}
4️⃣ Assignment Operators
Used to assign values.

Operator	Example
=	a = 10
+=	a += 5
-=	a -= 3
5️⃣ Unary Operators
Operate on a single operand.

Operator	Meaning
++	Increment
--	Decrement
Example:

int x = 5;
x++;
🧠 Key Learnings
Operators form the base of all logic in Java

Expressions are combinations of variables + operators

Understanding operators makes control statements easy (Day 4 🔜)

💻 Code Example

🎯 Interview Questions
Q1: Difference between == and =?
Answer:
= assigns a value
== compares two values

Q2: What does % operator do?
Answer:
Returns the remainder of a division.

Q3: What is short-circuit evaluation?
Answer:
Logical operators (&&, ||) stop evaluating once the result is known.

Q4: Output of this?
int a = 5;
System.out.println(a++ + ++a);
Answer: 11

✅ Day 04 Status
