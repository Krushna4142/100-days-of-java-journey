## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 007** was to understand and practice **looping constructs in Java**.

This day focused on:

- Writing repetitive logic efficiently
- Understanding loop flow and conditions
- Choosing the right loop for a given problem

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### Looping Statements in Java

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop

Each loop serves a different purpose depending on:

- Known vs unknown iterations
- Entry-controlled vs exit-controlled execution

---

## 🛠️ What I Practiced

I practiced basic loop-based programs including:

- Printing numbers in a sequence
- Calculating sum of numbers
- Generating multiplication tables
- Understanding loop termination conditions

The focus was on **logic clarity**, not complexity.

## 🧩 How Loops Work in Java

- A loop repeatedly executes a block of code
- Execution depends on a **condition**
- Loops reduce code duplication
- Incorrect conditions can lead to infinite loops

Java provides multiple loop types to handle different scenarios cleanly.

---

## 💻 Code Implementation

### ✔ Loop Demonstration Program

The program demonstrates:

- `for` loop for fixed iterations
- `while` loop for condition-based execution
- `do-while` loop for guaranteed single execution

📄 **Java Source File:**  
👉 [LoopsDemo.java](./LoopsDemo.java)

---

## 📝 Notes & Observations

- `for` loop is best when the number of iterations is known
- `while` loop is useful when iterations depend on a condition
- `do-while` executes at least once, even if condition is false
- Loop conditions must be handled carefully to avoid infinite loops

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Loops are fundamental to problem-solving
- Clean loop conditions improve readability
- Choosing the right loop simplifies logic
- Strong loop basics are critical for DSA and interviews

## 🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 07 Level)

**Q1. What is a loop in Java?**  
A loop allows repeated execution of a block of code as long as a condition is true.

**Q2. Difference between for and while loop?**  
`for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known, while `while` loop is used when it depends on a condition.

**Q3. What is a do-while loop?**  
It is an exit-controlled loop that executes at least once before checking the condition.

**Q4. What is an infinite loop?**  
A loop that never terminates because its condition never becomes false.
