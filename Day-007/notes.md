# Day 007 – Loops in Java (Notes)

## What is a Loop?

A loop allows a block of code to execute repeatedly until a condition becomes false.
Loops help avoid code repetition and make programs efficient.

## Types of Loops in Java

### 1️⃣ for Loop

- Used when the number of iterations is known
- Best for counters and fixed ranges

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; update)

Example use cases:

- Printing numbers
- Iterating over arrays
- Running fixed number of times

---

### 2️⃣ while Loop

- Used when iterations depend on a condition
- Condition is checked before execution

Best used when:

- Number of iterations is unknown
- Loop depends on user input or runtime conditions

---

### 3️⃣ do-while Loop

- Exit-controlled loop
- Executes at least once

Used when:

- Code must run at least one time
- Menu-driven programs

---

## Important Points to Remember

- Incorrect loop conditions can cause infinite loops
- Always update loop control variables
- Choose the loop based on problem requirement
- Readability matters more than clever logic

---

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to update counter
- Using wrong loop type
- Infinite loops due to incorrect conditions

---

## Interview Tip

Be ready to explain:

- Difference between for, while, and do-while
- When to use which loop
- What an infinite loop is
